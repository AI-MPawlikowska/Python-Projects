# 🐍 Python Projects by Marta

Welcome to my repository, born out of a mix of:
- 📚 learning Python step by step,
- ☕ way too much coffee,
- 🎉 the desire to build things that are not only useful but also fun.

## 🎯 Purpose of this repo
This is a collection of **mini Python projects** that I created after completing different learning modules.  
Each project serves as both a **knowledge check** and a chance to build something practical (or at least entertaining 😄).
